 0: THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF CLASS
   > THE CONCRETE CLASS THE SIMPLE CLASS WE ALWAYS USES
   > THE ABSTRACT CLASS
 1: THE CLASS IS ABSTRACT CLASS IF THERE ARE 0 OR MORE ABSTRACT METHOD
 2: THE OBJECT OF THE ABSTRACT CLASS CANNOT BE DEFINED AS IT CAN HAVE ONLY THE REFERENCE
 3: ben b;
 4: THE SUB CLASS WILL ALSO BE THE ABSTRACT CLASS AS IT WILL INHERIT THE METHOD OF THE ABSTRACT CLAS
 5: THE SUB CLASS WILL ONLY BECOME THE CONCRETE CLASS IF ALL THE METHOD OF THE ABSTRACT CLASS ARE DEFINED
 6: THESE CLASSES ARE MADE ONLY FOR THE INHERITANCE
 7: THE ABSTRACT CLASS IS USED TO DEFINE THE STANDARD SO THE SUB CLASS CAN BECOME THE CONCRETE CLASS
 8: THE ABSTRACT METHOD CANNOT BE FINAL , AND THE STATIC AND THE SAME GOES FOR THE ABSTRACT METHOD
 9: IF THERE IS AN ABSTRACT CLASS THEN THE CLASS WHICH IS EXTENDING THE ABSTRCT CLASS MUST OVERRIDE THE ABSTRACT METHOD OR ELSE IT WILL ALSO BECOME THE ABSTRACT CLASS
